# Android Studio - Comparing Trasport Options 
## IIT Master Thesis.

This project consists in the development of an Android Studio application that will allow their users to compare different transport options for selected origins and destinations. To start off, the user’s location is shown on screen and once the user tries to input a destination he will be guided to a section where he can input origin and destination. The origin address will be the user’s location but he can modify this if he wishes to. The user can also store his house and work locations in the app for future use, and when clicked the destination will be set to either work or home, depending on what the user clicks. When referencing transport options, I am talking about Ride sharing, Car sharing, Bike sharing, public transport and walking options. Now I will proceed to explain each option and what has been implemented on each one.
